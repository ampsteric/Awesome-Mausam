## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

This project was created and developed with the motive to make it as simple as possible especially for the people who are not familiar with advanced tech. Keeping all the things in mind a simple weather app should have, we have included all the necessary features required to check the weather of a particular location as well as geo-locating oneself and checking out their location's weather.

## HOW TO GET STARTED?

- Open the CMD in windows.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

```sh
git clone [URL]
```

- Now run `npm install` to install all the node packages.

```sh
npm install
```

- And then run `npm start` to start the web-UI in development mode. 

```sh
npm start
```
- Open ***http://localhost:3000*** to view it in the browser.
```sh
port:3000
```
